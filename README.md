# snake_game

## Overview

This project is a classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library for rendering and Tkinter for the user interface. The game involves controlling a snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls and itself.

## Features

- **Snake Movement:** The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
- **Food Generation:** Food is randomly generated on the screen for the snake to eat.
- **Scoring:** Score increases each time the snake eats food.
- **Collision Detection:** The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
- **Restart Option:** Players have the option to restart the game after it ends.
- **User Interface:** Implemented using Tkinter for basic GUI elements.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle graphics library (usually included in Python standard library)
- Tkinter library (usually included in Python standard library)

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
